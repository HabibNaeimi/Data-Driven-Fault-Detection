Observability for network services — time-series anomaly detection (INRETE),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.7,GO,Data quality/missingness; limited/no labels; alert fatigue; NDA/data access timing.,"Is telemetry accessible from week 1? Any NDA preventing thesis use? Who is the weekly mentor and cadence? What are success metrics (FAR/day, TTD)? What stack is used on-site (Prometheus/Elastic/Grafana)?",Networking telemetry KPIs; seasonality-aware detection & HIL explainability,Build STL+MAD+PELT baseline on a sample trace; add motif/discord discovery; Streamlit triage view with ‘Explain’ panel; draft KPI→cause playbook.
